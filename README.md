# üõ†Ô∏è SQL Practice Project (Using ChatGPT)

This repository contains a hands-on SQL learning project where I created a relational database, wrote queries from basic to advanced levels, and practiced essential SQL concepts including joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.

## üìö Project Overview

The goal of this project was to improve my SQL skills step by step. I created a realistic database schema with the help of ChatGPT, wrote and solved queries on my own, and used ChatGPT to validate and learn from my answers.

### Key Components:
- ‚úÖ Designed **4 interrelated tables**: `departments`, `employees`, `projects`, `employee_projects`
- ‚úÖ Inserted sample data with real-world structure (5‚Äì10 rows each)
- ‚úÖ Practiced and solved **over 25 queries** across:
  - Basic SELECTs
  - Filtering (`WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`)
  - Aggregations (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, etc.)
  - Joins (INNER, LEFT)
  - Subqueries
  - CASE statements
  - Date functions (`CURDATE()`, `TIMESTAMPDIFF()`)
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Window Functions (`RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `OVER()`)

## üßë‚Äçüíª How I Built It

1. I asked **ChatGPT** to help me define custom table structures and sample data.
2. I manually created the tables in **MySQL Workbench** using the generated SQL script.
3. Then, I asked ChatGPT to generate a variety of SQL questions, categorized by skill level.
4. I solved each query myself first, and then **cross-checked** my answers with ChatGPT to confirm correctness or learn a better approach.
5. CSV versions of all tables are included for easier loading and reuse.

## ü§ù Acknowledgements

Special thanks to **ChatGPT by OpenAI** for acting like a personal tutor throughout this project and helping me understand SQL better. All queries and concepts were either generated, validated, or explained using AI.
